# Project3 -  Linked Sequence Data Structure

## Name:


- Your Sequence class should be implemented as a separate .h and .cpp file.
- If you define other classes, (such as SequenceNode) you may use a separate class, or a class defined entirely within Class Sequence.
- Zip your entire project directory and turn it in via pilot. Make sure that all your files are included.

**Code that will not compile will receive a grade of zero.**

| Task                                                                                                                          | Points |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | 
| Can correctly create a Sequence, modify items with the [] operator, and print the contents of the sequence with the << operator |    5 | 
| Can create multiple, independent Sequence objects and print them 	|3|
| `push_back()` correctly adds to the end of an existing Sequence 	|3|
| `push_back()` can add elements to an empty Sequence 	|3|
| `pop_back()` correctly removes the last element of a Sequence 	|3|
| `pop_back()` on an empty Sequence throws an exception 	|1|
| `insert()` correctly adds an element in the correct position of an existing Sequence 	|3|
| `insert()` throws an exception when called with an invalid index 	|1|
| `front()` correctly returns the first element of a Sequence 	|2|
| `front()` throws an exception when called on an empty Sequence 	|1|
| `back()` correctly returns the last element of a Sequence 	|2|
| `back()` throws an exception when called on an empty Sequence 	|1|
| `empty()` returns 1 if the Sequence is empty, 0 otherwise 	|1|
| `size()` correctly returns the size of a Sequence 	|1|
| `clear()` correctly removes all elements of a Sequence |2|
| `erase()` correctly removes specified elements of a Sequence 	|3|
| `erase()` throws an exception when called with invalid parameters 	|1|
| The assignment operator (=) correctly produces an independent copy of a Sequence 	|3|
| The copy constructor correctly produces an independent copy of a Sequence 	|3|
| Code has no memory leaks 	|3|
| Your code is well organized, clearly written, and well-documented 	|5|
